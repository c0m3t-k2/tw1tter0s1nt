# Updates 2021.5

# Supported envoirenments!

 - This tool is designed to work with Linux. However, even if it should work with any Linux distro, it doesn't. And it's hard to keep up with tests since this tool
is ran just by myself. So here are the supported envoirenments/distros in 2021.5 ; tw1tter0s1nt v_1.9 :

==============================

 - Linux Mint 
 - Kali Linux 
 
==============================

 - I am aware that both Kali and Parrot are based on debian-testing so technically they should work the same, but I found when I Parrot OS was an official testing
distro for my project, that my program behaves differently. Since Linux Mint is my daily driver and Kali is my favourite + most well known pentesting distro, I 
have decided to limit the tests to these 2 distros.

# Anonimity

 - As the twint library suggests, the tool(s) based using the twint python library scrapes Twitter using the API, NOT an account such as OSiNTGram does with Instagram.
 So technically, you shouldn't be paranoid about anonimity unless you are doing bad things with the information.
 
 - But, if you still want anonimty, then proxychains or anonsurf should do the trick. However, the stealth-mode is comming soon and you guys will be able to use
my proxies that I scrape from different public sources in conjuction with Tor (if wanted). I do not really recommend Tor for hacking since it was and still is used
to catch hackers, however, this is for educational-purposes and for legit penetration testers so I am not paranoid. Just keep in mind that the NSA and other agencies
host their own malicious exit nodes to capture your traffic.

# Debian Problem

 - So there's a problem with the original flavour of Debian 10 .
 - I have recently switched from Mint to Debian since I really do not need the additional software managers etc. that Mint comes pre-installed with. But there's a slight problem 
 - Twint cannot be properly installed on the original flavour of Debian
 - Some how, for some reason, I just cannot get Twint to work on Debian. And as you know, tw1tter0s1nt uses Twint, so obviously tw1tter0s1nt DOES NOT work on Debian. Why does it work on Kali (since it's debian based). I have no idea
 - I am trouble-shooting for a few days now.
 - I'll get back ASAP.
