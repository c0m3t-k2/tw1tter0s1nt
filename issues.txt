Hello everybody!

My name is c0m3t-k2 and I am the developer of tw1tter0s1nt.
This tool automates the process of the Twitter OSiNT investigation.
It is a python script, using the library 'twint' /// More on their Github page : https://github.com/twintproject/twint

WARNING!!!

 - tw1tter0s1nt or I are not related to twint in any way.
 - tw1tter0s1nt was just an idea that I had which fortunetly came to life!
 
Since this is an automated tool, it's great for script-kiddies, as well for advanced penetration testers who are looking for a more sraight forward way to Twitter
investigations.

The tool does not include any kind of illegal ways of extracting information.
It only uses the twitter open source intelligence resources. /// More on the twint Github page : https://github.com/twintproject/twint
With that in mind, I am not responsible in any way! Any misuse of tw1tter0s1nt is strictly your responsibility.

Always remember : With great power, comes great responsibility!
