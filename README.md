# INTRODUCTION 

Hello everybody, I go by the name c0m3t-k2 or falkensmaze.

I have created this tool for begginers, to automate the process of twint.

- This python tool uses the twint library to automate the Twitter OSiNT Investigation steps.

- You just have to fill up the required information and select your chosen investigation and it's done!

- I will update this tool whenever new ideas pop in my head so let me know if you find any bugs or if you can help me improve the tool!

# UPDATE :
 
  - 'Till now the tool was very automated, you only needed to put in the username and select the option
  - Right now tough, it is much more interesting. 
  - You can use the tool like a terminal cmd-line interface.
  - If you get stuck, type in 'help'
  - And for all of the script kiddies out there that want everything automated, don't worry , I re-coded an automation file "automation.py"

# twint INSTALLATION :

  - git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/twintproject/twint.git
  - cd twint
  - pip3 install . -r requirements.txt

# twosint INSTALLATION :
  - git clone https://github.com/c0m3t-k2/tw1tter0s1nt.git
  - cd tw1tter0s1nt
  - pip install -r requirements.txt / pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  - chmod +x twosint.py
  - python3 twosint.py
 
If the requirements file doesn't work, type in : pip3 install twint

# WHO IS THIS TOOL FOR? : 
  - Penetration testers/Ethical hackers
  - IT students that are looking for something cool to search.
  - OSiNT investigators (This tool is a MUST for you! It makes the job much more faster and efficient!)
  - Journalists who are looking for more information on a specific celebrity or person

 Some things to note:
 - You NEED the python library twint. Installation gudie right here : https://github.com/twintproject/twint
 - The author of the tool is not responsible in any way of one's misactions using tw1tter0s1nt.
 - Please keep in mind that this is a tool made by only a person and so it is hard to keep up with all the bugs and issues.
 - Still, if you find any bugs, report them in the issues section!

# TESTED ENVIRONMENTS:
 - Kali Linux ==> Fully supported
 - Pop!_OS ==> Fully supported


# Automation Script Announcmnet
 - I put a lot of hard work in developing and maintaining the original twosint.py script . 
 - The automation script usually for script kiddies is a better copy of the old automated tw1tter0sn1t.py file
 - It is completely usable however , I wanted to announce this :
      - Maintance updates will be applied once every month!
      - Module updates will be applied 2 weeks after twosint.py BETA update
      - Aesthetic (if any) will be applied 4 weeks after twosint.py will be updated
      - Security updates will still be initiated right after I or someone else discoveres a hole in the script (I want my users to have a secure OSiNT investigation)
 - What I am trying to do is create a Twiiter OSiNT framework!
 - The tool will still automate a lot of subprocess that you will have to go through if you would do it without the script.
 - Using the automation.py script is not wrong , however in some time I will probably end its updates!
 - If the tool will get attention and if you want to contribute to it, you can absolutely implement the new features from twosint-framework to the automation file.
 - The problem is that I do NOT have enough time to update the automation software fast.
# Basic ussage:

Anyone can contribute to this tool , but don't steal code nerd!
