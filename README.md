Hello everybody, I go by the name c0m3t-k2 or falkensmaze.

I have created this tool for begginers, to automate the process of twint.

- This python tool uses the twint library to automate the Twitter OSiNT Investigation steps.

- You just have to fill up the required information and select your chosen investigation and it's done!

- I will update this tool whenever new ideas pop in my head so let me know if you find any bugs or if you can help me improve the tool!

# UPDATE :
 
  - 'Till now the tool was very automated, you only needed to put in the username and select the option
  - Right now tough, it is much more interesting. 
  - You can use the tool like a terminal cmd-line interface.
  - If you get stuck, type in 'help'
  - And for all of the script kiddies out there that want everything automated, don't worry , I re-coded an automation file "automation.py"

# twint INSTALLATION :

  - git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/twintproject/twint.git
  - cd twint
  - pip3 install . -r requirements.txt

# twosint INSTALLATION :
  - git clone https://github.com/c0m3t-k2/tw1tter0s1nt.git
  - cd tw1tter0s1nt
  - pip install -r requirements.txt / pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  - chmod +x twosint.py
  - python3 twosint.py
 
If the requirements file doesn't work, type in : pip3 install twint

# WHO IS THIS TOOL FOR? : 
  - Penetration testers/Ethical hackers
  - IT students that are looking for something cool to search.
  - OSiNT investigators (This tool is a MUST for you! It makes the job much more faster and efficient!)
  - Journalists who are looking for more information on a specific celebrity or person

 Some things to note:
 - You NEED the python library twint. Installation gudie right here : https://github.com/twintproject/twint
 - The author of the tool is not responsible in any way of one's misactions using tw1tter0s1nt.
 - Please keep in mind that this is a tool made by only a person and so it is hard to keep up with all the bugs and issues.
 - Still, if you find any bugs, report them in the issues section!
