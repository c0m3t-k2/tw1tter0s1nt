Hello everybody, I go by the name c0m3t-k2 or just c0m3t.

I have created this tool for begginers, to automate the process of twint.

- This python tool uses the twint library to automate the Twitter OSiNT Investigation steps.

- You just have to fill up the required information and select your chosen investigation and it's done!

- I will update this tool whenever new ideas pop in my head so let me know if you find any bugs or if you can help me improve the tool!

 - The author of the tool is not responsible in any way of one's misactions using tw1tter0s1nt.

Anyone can use this tool as it's open source and ready to go, however, these are the people who will most likely add tw1tter0s1nt in their tool-kit!
