Python tool that automates the process of Twitter OSiNT investigation using twint.

Hello everybody, I go by the name c0m3t-k2 or just c0m3t.

I have created this tool for begginers, to automate the process of twint.

- This python tool uses the twint library to automate the Twitter OSiNT Investigation steps.

- You just have to fill up the required information and select your chosen investigation and it's done!

- I will update this tool whenever new ideas pop in my head so let me know if you find any bugs or if you can help me improve the tool!

REQUIREMENTS : 

  - twint fully installed  (https://github.com/twintproject/twint)
  - A Linux distro

Thanks, c0m3t-k2!
