Hello everybody, I go by the name c0m3t-k2 or falkensmaze.

I have created this tool for begginers, to automate the process of twint.

- This python tool uses the twint library to automate the Twitter OSiNT Investigation steps.

- You just have to fill up the required information and select your chosen investigation and it's done!

- I will update this tool whenever new ideas pop in my head so let me know if you find any bugs or if you can help me improve the tool!

# INSTALLATION :

  - git clone https://github.com/c0m3t-k2/tw1tter0s1nt.git
  - cd tw1tter0s1nt
  - pip install -r requirements.txt / pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  - chmod +x tw1tter0s1nt.py
  - python3 tw1tter0s1nt.py
 
If the requirements file doesn't work, type in : pip3 install twint

# WHO IS THIS TOOL FOR? : 
  - Penetration testers/Ethical hackers
  - IT students that are looking for something cool to search.
  - OSiNT investigators (This tool is a MUST for you! It makes the job much more faster and efficient!)
  - Journalists who are looking for more information on a specific celebrity or person

 Some things to note:
 - You NEED the python library twint. Installation gudie right here : https://github.com/twintproject/twint
 - The author of the tool is not responsible in any way of one's misactions using tw1tter0s1nt.
 - Please keep in mind that this is a tool made by only a person and so it is hard to keep up with all the bugs and issues.
 - Still, if you find any bugs, report them in the issues section!

Anyone can use this tool as it's open source and ready to go, however, these are the people who will most likely add tw1tter0s1nt in their tool-kit!

CURRENT VERSION --> tw1tter0s1nt 1.8

Thanks, c0m3t-k2!
